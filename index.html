    <td><div class="about"> Hello, My name is Tiffany Aihara and I am a freshman at University of California, Irvine. I am majoring in Computer Science. The language that I am currently learning is Python, but I do have prior experience in HTML and Javascript. Besides coding, I like to dance and draw. I am currently participating in the U.C.I's Spirit Squad which performs at the school and does community events. I also have an interest in game design. During the summer of 2016, I took a course at N.Y.U about programming and understanding games. Along with two other classmates, that soon became my friends, we designed a game that highlight our skills. My favorite food is tiramisu and my, current, favorite T.V show is Riverdale. I would like to continue my knowledge in computer science and learn more languages and skills that will help me succeed in the technology industry.<strong> <a href = "https://codepen.io/tiffaihara/">CLICK HERE TO VIEW CODEPEN</a></strong></p>

        <div class="why"> Hi, My name is Tiffany and I am a senior in high school. I am a dancer and a game designer. My favorite TV show are Criminal Minds, American Horror Story, Scream, Project Runway, Guilt, Dance Moms, The Fosters, and America's Next Top Model. I
          am not an early bird but on some occasions, I will wake up early. My favorite article of clothing are shoes. My pet peeve is when someone steps on my white shoes on the first day I got them. Creativity revolves around my life.The software that
          was used is called Game Maker. It does not work on OS software unless system prefences allows it. Preferences are edited to fit functions. The Game was created by the help of my friends That I met at NYU. This game might have some glitiches.
          It depends on the software version. </p>

        <div class = "box"> <img src = "http://avalanchestudios.com/static/img/global/logo-black-fb.jpg" style= float:right; height=153px; width=180px;>During the summer program I attended, I visited a game studio called "Avalanche". This company creates games such as the Just Cause Series, the Hunter, and Mad Max. We were introduced to the President of Avalanche who was in charge of their New York location. They showed us the process of creating/developing a game, human interaction/animations, visual representation such as atmosphere, other characters, etc., and audio. For the visual representation, they wanted the atmosphere and the environment to look realistic. They visit national parks and take pictures of the landscape. From their trip to different locations, they use this application where they can copy the image they took and replicate it onto a software.  <br> </div>  </div>
